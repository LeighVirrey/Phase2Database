If you want to access the code for ZK portion, open in Jetbrains, 
allow it access to whatever
have the SDK be openJDK 19(in the top right corner it'll ask for what sdk)
in LvirreyDatabase/src is where all the code portion is
main is where you should configure the run too.
if a problem persists with file reading then head to the IO file and configure the pathing to fit where it needs to be but it should already work.
